    <h2>Vegan Lasagna with greens</h2>

    <p>This vegan lasagna is perfect! It tastes exactly like a classic, 
        traditional lasagna, but it is meatless and dairy-free. 
        Lasagna sheets are layered with creamy, tofu-free ricotta 
        cheese, homemade vegan parmesan, vegan mozzarella shreds, 
        and a meaty marinara that's so tasty you'll want to eat it out 
        of the pot! It's perfect comfort food for a family pasta dinner, 
        a potluck, or a holiday gathering.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegan cheese</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the ricotta cheese. Place cashews in a food processor with all ingredients. Process for a couple of minutes until fairly smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles. Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente but not mushy. If you use no boil noodles you don't have to cook them first.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna. Spray a 12 X 9 inch lasagna pan or baking dish with cooking spray or oil. Ladle out a small amount of sauce into the pan and spread. Layer on four sheets of the noodles into the bottom of the pan. If using no-boil noodles, which are smaller than regular noodles, you might need to layer on five noodles vertically and one more horizontally.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, place the lasagna pan on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the aluminum foil and bake another 30 minutes until bubbly and hot. Let the lasagna stand at least 15 minutes to firm up, then cut and serve.</li>
        <li>You don't need to serve much alongside this classic vegan lasagna, because it's a full meal on its own, but some Vegan Garlic Pull Apart Bread and a fresh salad like this Vegan Caesar Salad are the perfect accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
